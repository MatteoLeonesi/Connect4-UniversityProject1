connect4
The project is a faithful representation of the famous board game, Connect4. Connect4 is an abstract two-player board game in which players initially choose a color/symbol and alternate in turn by placing pieces or disks in one grid of 7 columns and 6 rows. The grid is placed in a vertical position and the disks, when inserted, occupy the first position available starting from the bottom. The objective of the game is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of 4 discs of their own color.

The symbols used are CROSS (X) and CIRCLE (O), at the end of each game it is possible to start a new one or exit the game.
